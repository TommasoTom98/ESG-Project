The project required choosing a paper from a list of topics related to ESG or Cryptocurrencies themes, 
with the aim of developing a new paper based on the chosen theme.

I chose the paper titled "_The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change_" to conduct a study on how climate shocks 
affect the macroeconomic system.
